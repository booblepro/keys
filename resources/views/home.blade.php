            Yes, your private key is on this website too, but don't worry, nobody will ever find it.

        <h2 class="mb-2">How does this work?</h2>
        <p class="leading-normal">
            A private key is basically just a number between 1 and 2<sup>256</sup>.
            This website generates keys for all of those numbers, spread out over pages of 128 keys each.
            <br>
            <br>
            This website doesn't actually have a database of all private keys, that would take an impossible amount of disk space.
            Instead, keys are procedurally generated on the fly when a page is opened.
            The page number is used to calculate which keys should be on that page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finding an active wallet is hard, but not impossible.
            Every time you open a random page, you have a chance of finding someone else's fortune.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're curious which page your wallet is on, you could do a <a class="underline" href="{{ route('btcPages.search') }}">search</a> for it.
            That will show you exactly which page your wallet is on.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-2">Automatic balance checking</h2>
        <p class="leading-normal">
            The balance of each wallet is automatically checked.
            Wallets with a balance are colored green.
            Wallets that have been used in the past but are now empty will turn yellow.
            Wallets that have never been used are red.
